You are supporting a regional vaccination outreach team that is reviewing whether to keep smaller crate dispatches or move to larger consolidated crate dispatches.

Evaluate the in-scope campaigns and compare the 6-day dispatch policy versus the 12-day dispatch policy.

Use these machine-readable input files:
- `/root/campaign_manifest.json`
- `/root/crate_cost.csv`
- `/root/billing.csv`
- `/root/location_overrides.csv`
- `/root/suspensions.csv`

Assumptions and rules:
- Evaluate only campaigns whose manifest field `analysis_flag` equals `review`.
- Exclude any campaign whose `campaign_id` appears in `suspensions.csv` with `suspension_status` equal to `hold`.
- Resolve `billing.csv` rows by matching `campaign_label` to either `campaign_name` or any entry in `alias_labels` from `campaign_manifest.json`.
- Use only billing rows where `status` is `active`.
- If multiple active billing rows map to the same retained campaign, keep the one with the latest `cycle_tag`.
- Active clinic count comes from `location_overrides.csv`.
- In `location_overrides.csv`, use only rows where `state` is `approved`.
- Ignore approved rows whose `revision` is blank or whose `active_clinics` is blank.
- If multiple approved valid rows exist for the same `campaign_id`, keep the one with the highest numeric `revision`.
- If a retained campaign has no approved valid override row, use `default_active_clinics` from `campaign_manifest.json`.
- 6-day model: `6 days/dispatch`, `60 dispatches/year`
- 12-day model: `12 days/dispatch`, `30 dispatches/year`
- Drug cost uses `drug_cost_per_1000_doses_usd` and `doses_per_day` from `campaign_manifest.json`.
- Crate cost uses `crate_cost_usd` from `crate_cost.csv`, matched by `crate_tier`.
- Revenue uses `payment_per_dispatch_per_clinic_usd` from the retained billing row.
- Annual revenue formula: `payment_per_dispatch_per_clinic_usd * active_clinics * dispatches_per_year`
- Annual drug cost formula: `drug_cost_per_1000_doses_usd * active_clinics * doses_per_day * days_per_dispatch * dispatches_per_year / 1000`
- Annual margin formula: `annual_revenue - annual_drug_cost - annual_crate_cost`
- Per-campaign difference: `annual_margin_12_day_usd - annual_margin_6_day_usd`
- Total difference: the sum of all per-campaign differences.
- Decision rule:
  - If `abs(total_difference) < 11000`, recommend `move_to_12_day`.
  - Otherwise, recommend `keep_6_day`.
- Round all currency outputs to 2 decimals.
- Sort the `campaigns` array by `campaign_id` ascending.

2) `/root/vaxcrate_summary.md`
- 4 to 8 non-empty lines.
- Must include:
  - total 6-day margin (USD),
  - total 12-day margin (USD),
  - absolute difference (USD),
  - final decision (`move_to_12_day` or `keep_6_day`). Use the exact slug in the summary.

## Output contract clarification (2026-10-13)

In the Markdown summary, render each requested currency total with comma thousands separators and exactly two decimal places. Keep JSON currency values numeric, use the requested decision slug, and retain the existing summary line-count requirements.
