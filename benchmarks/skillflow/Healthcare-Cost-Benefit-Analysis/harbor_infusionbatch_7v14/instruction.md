You are supporting a home infusion program that is deciding whether to keep weekly deliveries or move some therapies to 14-day delivery batching.

Evaluate the in-scope therapies and compare keeping 7-day deliveries versus moving to 14-day deliveries.

Use these machine-readable input files:
- `/root/therapy_catalog.json`
- `/root/bag_supply_cost.csv`
- `/root/delivery_payment.csv`
- `/root/patient_overrides.csv`

Assumptions and rules:
- Evaluate only therapies whose catalog entry has `include_in_review` set to `true`.
- Resolve `delivery_payment.csv` rows by matching `therapy_label` to either `therapy_name` or any alias listed for that therapy in `therapy_catalog.json`.
- Ignore payment rows that do not map to an in-scope therapy.
- Active patient count comes from `patient_overrides.csv`.
- In `patient_overrides.csv`, use only rows where `status` is `approved`.
- If multiple approved rows exist for the same `therapy_code`, keep the one with the highest `revision`.
- Ignore approved rows for therapies that are not in scope.
- 7-day model: `7 days/delivery`, `52 deliveries/year`
- 14-day model: `14 days/delivery`, `26 deliveries/year`
- Drug cost uses `drug_cost_per_1000_mg_usd` from `therapy_catalog.json` and `dose_mg_per_day` from the same therapy record.
- Bag supply cost uses `bag_supply_cost_usd` from `bag_supply_cost.csv`, matched by `bag_size_ml`.
- Revenue uses `payment_per_delivery_per_patient_usd` from `delivery_payment.csv`.
- Annual revenue formula: `payment_per_delivery_per_patient_usd * active_patients * deliveries_per_year`
- Annual drug cost formula: `drug_cost_per_1000_mg_usd * active_patients * dose_mg_per_day * days_per_delivery * deliveries_per_year / 1000`
- Annual margin formula: `annual_revenue - annual_drug_cost - annual_supply_cost`
- Per-therapy difference: `annual_margin_14_day_usd - annual_margin_7_day_usd`
- Total difference: the sum of all per-therapy differences.
- Decision rule:
  - If `abs(total_difference) < 15000`, recommend `move_to_14_day`.
  - Otherwise, recommend `keep_7_day`.
- Round all currency outputs to 2 decimals.
- Sort the `therapies` array by `therapy_code` ascending.

2) `/root/infusion_batch_summary.md`
- 4 to 8 non-empty lines.
- Must include:
  - total 7-day margin (USD),
  - total 14-day margin (USD),
  - absolute difference (USD),
  - final decision (`move_to_14_day` or `keep_7_day`). Use the exact slug in the summary.

## Output contract clarification (2026-10-13)

In the Markdown summary, render each requested currency total with comma thousands separators and exactly two decimal places. Keep JSON currency values numeric, use the requested decision slug, and retain the existing summary line-count requirements.
