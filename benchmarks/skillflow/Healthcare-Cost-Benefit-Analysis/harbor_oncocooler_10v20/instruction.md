You are supporting an oncology supportive-care program that is reviewing whether to keep frequent cooler dispatches or move to larger, less frequent dispatches.

Evaluate the in-scope programs and compare keeping 10-day dispatches versus moving to 20-day dispatches.

Use these machine-readable input files:
- `/root/program_catalog.json`
- `/root/cooler_cost.csv`
- `/root/contract_payment.csv`
- `/root/site_overrides.csv`

Assumptions and rules:
- Evaluate only programs whose catalog field `review_flag` equals `review`.
- Resolve `contract_payment.csv` rows by matching `program_label` to either `program_name` or any entry in `known_labels` from `program_catalog.json`.
- Ignore payment rows that do not map to an in-scope program.
- Active site count comes from `site_overrides.csv`.
- In `site_overrides.csv`, use only rows where `approval_state` is `approved`.
- If multiple approved rows exist for the same `program_code`, keep the one with the highest `version_no`.
- If an in-scope program has no approved override row, use `default_active_sites` from `program_catalog.json`.
- 10-day model: `10 days/dispatch`, `36 dispatches/year`
- 20-day model: `20 days/dispatch`, `18 dispatches/year`
- Drug cost uses `acquisition_cost_per_1000_units_usd` and `units_per_day` from `program_catalog.json`.
- Cooler cost uses `cooler_cost_usd` from `cooler_cost.csv`, matched by `cooler_type`.
- Revenue uses `payment_per_dispatch_per_site_usd` from `contract_payment.csv`.
- Annual revenue formula: `payment_per_dispatch_per_site_usd * active_sites * dispatches_per_year`
- Annual drug cost formula: `acquisition_cost_per_1000_units_usd * active_sites * units_per_day * days_per_dispatch * dispatches_per_year / 1000`
- Annual margin formula: `annual_revenue - annual_drug_cost - annual_cooler_cost`
- Per-program difference: `annual_margin_20_day_usd - annual_margin_10_day_usd`
- Total difference: the sum of all per-program differences.
- Decision rule:
  - If `abs(total_difference) < 10000`, recommend `move_to_20_day`.
  - Otherwise, recommend `keep_10_day`.
- Round all currency outputs to 2 decimals.
- Sort the `programs` array by `program_code` ascending.

2) `/root/oncocooler_summary.md`
- 4 to 8 non-empty lines.
- Must include:
  - total 10-day margin (USD),
  - total 20-day margin (USD),
  - absolute difference (USD),
  - final decision (`move_to_20_day` or `keep_10_day`). Use the exact slug in the summary.

## Output contract clarification (2026-10-13)

In the Markdown summary, render each requested currency total with comma thousands separators and exactly two decimal places. Keep JSON currency values numeric, use the requested decision slug, and retain the existing summary line-count requirements.
